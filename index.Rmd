I am a **PhD student** at ENS Lyon, in the Department of Economics at [**CERGIC** (Center for Economic Research on Governance, Inequality and Conflict)](https://www.cergic-lyon.fr/), under the supervision of [CÃ©dric Chambru](https://cedricchambru.github.io/). I graduated from ENSAE in 2022.

My PhD research focuses on exploring the interplay between **media and politics**, specifically examining the press in France during the long 19th century. I employ a range of analytical methods, including Econometrics, Natural Language Processing, and Network analysis.

I have a few other interests including Sociology of Science, chess, bringing back Cliometrics and backpacking in Java.
