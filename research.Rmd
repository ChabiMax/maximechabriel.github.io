## Projects

### Press freedom restrictions effects on self-censorship

The goal of this research project is to provide evidence of the effect of censorship policies both on
censorship and self-censorship using an innovative lexicometric measure of dissent and press freedom. We may
want to use the diminishing returns of this effect to explain the rise of democracy and the disappearance of
authoritarian regimes in France during the long 19th century. Collaboration with [Beno√Æt de Courson](https://regicid.github.io/).
